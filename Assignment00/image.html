      This image accurately captures my state of mind when I am coding an
      assignment that should be incredibly simple, but the instructions are so
      confusing that I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, even though it's
      just HTML! Why are the tags in the instructions all uppercase? Who uses
      uppercase tags in HTML?!
