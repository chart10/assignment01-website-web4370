    <h1>Formatting Text (Index Page)</h1>

    <h2>Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h2>

    Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little
    control over the way that a page is displayed. <br />It should be remembered
    that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document
    not as a way of determining its presentation.
    <p>
      Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from
      formatting text to appear
    </p>
    in a printed document.
